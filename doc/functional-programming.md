# Functional Programming

### Does the language support functional programming?
#### PHP
[Yes](http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/Functional-Programming.html), because PHP allows the passing of function references. Accordingly, PHP has iterative abilities and factory/generator classes can be implemented.
#### Python
[Yes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/functional.html), Python offers several features that allow for functional programming. Namely, [iterators](https://docs.python.org/3.6/glossary.html#term-iterator) and [generators](https://docs.python.org/3.6/glossary.html#term-generator).
