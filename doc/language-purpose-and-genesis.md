# Language Purpose & Genesis

### Why was the language created?
#### PHP
Created originally to provide a functionality layer in web applications. It was created in 1994 to build simple and response web applications in an era of mostly static web content.
#### Python
Created in the late 1980s to early 1990s, Python was originally created as a side project and successor to the [ABC language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)) that would appeal to Unix and C developers.

### What problems does the language address?
#### PHP
PHP mainly addresses the issue of server-side scripting and easily allowing dynamically (and programmatically) generated web content. It is not primarily intended for desktop or heavily GUI dependent applications, although it is possible.
#### Python
Python is a general purpose language that can be adapted for many uses. The ease of development and more lax language rules allowed for a large community and library support. Natively Python can be used for scripting, network applications, and logic-centered applications, namely in the education and scientific fields. With appropriate libraries Python can be used for desktop GUI-dependent applications, creating development environments, data parsing/processing, and even web applications and web service hosting.

### Is the language a reaction to previous languages or intended as a language replacement?
#### PHP
PHP was intended to fill the lack of easy server-side scripting and dynamic web content, rather than a specific language replacement or successor. Although, PHP was influenced by predecessors like [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).
#### Python
Python was originally developed as a successor to the [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)) language. It has, however, now taken on a life of its own.
