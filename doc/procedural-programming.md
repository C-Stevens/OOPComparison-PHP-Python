# Procedural Programming

### Does the language support procedural programming?
#### PHP
[Yes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1530868/simple-explanation-php-oop-vs-procedural), PHP is ultimately intended as a server-side scripting language, with thorough object oriented abilities being added in subsequent versions. As such, you can develop either object oriented or procedurally.
#### Python
[Yes](https://study.com/academy/lesson/object-oriented-programming-vs-procedural-programming.html), Python can function not only as an object oriented development language, but also a procedural scripting-like environment.
